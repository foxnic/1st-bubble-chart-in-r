# 1st-bubble-chart-in-r
My first attempt at creating a bubble chart scatter plot in R.
Reads in a small dummy data set about 5 data analytics tools, with a rating for flexibility, easiness, presentation capability and type (interactive or static).
Creates a bubble chart with semi-transparent colours representing the type of tool, size of bubble representing the easiness,
flexibility as the y-axis and presentation as the x-axis.
Displays text labels in dark grey and includes a key (legend).
